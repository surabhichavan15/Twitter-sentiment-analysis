Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to classify tweets as either positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset used in this project contains tweets related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle: Coronavirus Tweets NLP - Text Classification.

Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Steps Involved
1. Data Exploration:
Explores the dataset to understand the features and characteristics of the data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Cleans and prepares the data for NLP by removing stop words, stemming, and tokenizing the text.

3. Feature Extraction:
Extracts features from the text using various techniques such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings.

4. Model Building:
Builds several machine learning models using scikit-learn, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.

5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tunes the parameters of the best performing model using grid search to improve its performance.

7. Prediction:
Uses the final model to predict the sentiment of tweets in the test dataset.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using NLP. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can learn how to clean and prepare text data for NLP, extract relevant features, build and evaluate machine learning models, and make predictions on new data. The Jupyter Notebook on GitHub allows anyone to reproduce the results and further explore the dataset.
